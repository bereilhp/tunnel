# Calculate Distance from point A to B from an image

## Run program 
```
python3 tunnel.py
```

## Instructions
1. A window will pop up displaying a sketch of a train (red) inside a tunnel (black).
2. Click on any location inside the window. A dot or circle will appear this is point1.
3. Click again at a different location to create point2. This will measure the distance between point1 and point2, representing the distance between the train and the tunnel.
4. After clicking the second time, the distance between point1 and point2 will be measured, and it will appear on the image in the window once you click a third time.
5. Continue clicking if you want to measure the distance between other points on the image.
6. The results, with the marked points and measured distances, will be saved in an image file named "resultado.png" in the program's directory.

**_NOTE:_**  The program will continue measuring distances and saving the image with every third click. To exit the program, simply hit the ESC key.
